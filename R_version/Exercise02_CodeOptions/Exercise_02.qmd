# Creating initial variables

Let's create a first variable x, with value 25

```{r}

x = 25
```

Then, let's create a second variable y, with value 4

```{r}

y = 4
```

# Multiplying the variables

Now, we'll multiply the variables with each other and store the result in a variable z, and print z

```{r}

z = x*y
print(z)
```
